# My first FullStack Project from Database to Frontend.

---

I used the **MERN** stack, and I was able to make the project thanks to Fazt and his YouTube videos, specifically _[this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zm5gpipw3HM)_. I followed him step by step thinking and trying undestand all the concepts what, for me, is the most important thing.

If you want to test it, youÂ´ll need to look at the "/server/config.js" file that contains the environment variables. The project was developed with MongoDB Atlas.
