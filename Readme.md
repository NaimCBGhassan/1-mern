# [FormuPics](https://formupics-project.up.railway.app/)

My first FullStack Project from Database to Frontend.

### Database and Photos

For the database was used MongoDB Atlas and to save the photos was used Cloudinary.

### Server

The server was developed with NodeJS and ExpressJS. It has five endpoint to get **all** posts and get, create, update and delete **a** post.

### Client

The Client was developed with ReactJS and React Query, React Router Dom and others libraries.

### About Project

I used the **MERN** stack, and was able to make the project thanks to Fazt and his YouTube videos, specifically _[this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zm5gpipw3HM)_. I followed him step by step thinking and trying undestand all the concepts of what, for me, is the most important thing.
